## Features

- **RESTful API** built with Node.js to handle:
  - Parking data (creation, retrieval, modification, and deletion).
  - Usage statistics (affluence tracking over time).
  - User authentication and administration.
- **Docker-based** deployment for consistent and portable releases.
- **Automated** CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for:
  - Linting, building, and testing.
  - Automated semantic versioning with [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release).
  - Docker image building and publishing.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js** (latest stable version)
- **npm** for dependency management
- **Docker** for containerization
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD
- **PostgreSQL** (optional, if you’re using a local DB; otherwise you can point to a managed DB)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v23.2.0 or higher)
- **npm** (comes bundled with Node.js)
- **Docker** (if you plan to run or build Docker images locally)
- **Git** for version control
- A running **PostgreSQL** (or other) database, if needed

### Installation

1. **Clone** the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IzaakAM/mobeasy.git
   cd mobeasy
   ```

2. **Install** dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up** environment variables:  
   Create a `.env` file (or similar) to store sensitive configs like database credentials, tokens, etc. For example:
   ```bash
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=postgres
   DB_PASSWORD=secret
   DB_DATABASE=mobeasy
   PORT=3000
   ```

### Running the Project Locally

```bash
npm start
```

By default, the API should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`. Adjust as needed per your configuration.

### Using Docker

To build and run the container locally:

1. **Build** the image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t mobeasy-api:local .
   ```

2. **Run** the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name mobeasy mobeasy-api:local
   ```
   
Now, the API should be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`) that runs automatically on every push or pull request to `main` or `develop` branches. The pipeline performs the following steps:

1. **Checkout** the repository.  
2. **Setup Node.js** environment (Node v23.2.0).  
3. **Install dependencies** and run any necessary build or test scripts.  
4. **Semantic Release** to handle automated versioning and Git tags.  
5. **Build Docker image** and **push** to a Docker registry (e.g., `registry.robin-joseph.fr`) using the appropriate credentials.  
6. **Tag and push** the Docker image based on the current branch or Git tag.

You can customize these steps in the `ci-cd.yml` file to fit your own environment and deployment strategy.

## Contributing

1. **Fork** the project.
2. Create a new feature branch:  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   ```
3. **Commit** your changes:  
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add some cool feature"
   ```
4. **Push** to your branch:  
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-new-feature
   ```
5. Create a new **Pull Request** against the `develop` branch.
